COMMANDS:
   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --profile-name value, --pn value, -n value      Name for this profile, used in status values. (default: "missing-profile-name")
   --cron value, -c value                          Cron expression. When specified, the profile is not run immediately followed by the program exiting. Rather, it is run according to the passed cron schedule.
   --source value, -s value                        Source path(s) passed to rsync. Specify multiple times for multiple values.
   --target value, -t value                        Required. Target path. This should be an absolute folder path. For paths on remote hosts, --target-host must be specified. For custom SSH options, such as  target host user/port, pass the -e option to rsync using --rsync-options.
   --target-host value, --th value                 Target host

   --rsync-options value, -r value                 Extra rsync options. Note that -a and --link-dest are always prepended to these because they are central to how this tool works. -e "ssh ..." is also prepended; if you require custom SSH options, pass them in --ssh-options.
